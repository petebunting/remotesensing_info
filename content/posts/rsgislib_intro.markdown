## Introduction

The Remote Sensing and GIS Software Library [RSGISLib](https://www.rsgislib.org)  is primarily developed by Pete Bunting and Dan Clewley, it was originally designed to just provide the functionality we required for our own research, where it wasn't available in existing software packages. However, RSGISLib has evolved into a set of Python modules providing a wide range of functionality which is scriptable, creating a flexible system for data analysis and batch processing. The available module are:

* Image Calibration
* Classification
* Elevation
* Image Calculations
* Image Filtering
*  Image Morphology
* Image Registration
* Image Utilities
* Histogram Cube
* Raster GIS
* Image Segmentation
* Tools
* Vector Utilities
* Zonal Statistics
