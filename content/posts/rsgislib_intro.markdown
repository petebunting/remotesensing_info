## Introduction

The Remote Sensing and GIS Software Library [RSGISLib](https://www.rsgislib.org) is primarily developed and supported by Pete Bunting and Dan Clewley; it was initially developed to provide the functionality we required for our research, where it wasn't available in existing software packages. However, RSGISLib has evolved into a set of Python modules providing a wide range of functionality which is scriptable, creating a flexible system for data analysis and batch processing. The available modules are:

* Image Calibration
* Classification
* Elevation
* Image Calculations
* Image Filtering
*  Image Morphology
* Image Registration
* Image Utilities
* Histogram Cube
* Raster GIS
* Image Segmentation
* Tools
* Vector Utilities
* Zonal Statistics
