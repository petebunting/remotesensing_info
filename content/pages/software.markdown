Summary: Software Tools and Installation

## Installation

### Conda

If you wish to install RSGISLib, ARCSI and the other tools we make available using the conda Python package manager then this video provides a complete run through of the process:

The commands for completing the installation are:
    
    :::bash
    # Create a New Environment
    conda create -n osgeo-env-v1 python=3.7
    
    # Change to the environment
    source activate osgeo-env-v1
    
    # Install Software
    conda install -c conda-forge arcsi tuiview 
    
    # If you have any problems following installation then try running:
    conda update -c conda-forge --all

### Docker and Singularity
The easiest way to install our software is through Docker or Singularity, as shown below:
    
    :::bash
    # Pull the docker image to your local system
    docker pull petebunting/au-eoed
    
    # Pull the docker image using singularity
    singularity pull docker://petebunting/au-eoed

## Software We Maintain

### RSGISLib
[https://www.rsgislib.org](https://www.rsgislib.org)

The remote sensing and GIS software library, tools for processing image and vector datasets using Python.

### ARCSI
[https://arcsi.remotesensing.info](https://arcsi.remotesensing.info)

A set of tools for the automated productions of Analysis Ready Optical Data (ARD). Supports Landsat, Sentinel-2, Rapideye, WorldView etc.

### EODataDown
[https://eodatadown.remotesensing.info](https://eodatadown.remotesensing.info)

Software for creating an EO based monitoring system.

### KEALib

HDF5 based image file format with GDAL driver.

### SPDLib
[http://www.spdlib.org](http://www.spdlib.org) 

HDF5 based file format for LiDAR data and tools for processing LiDAR datasets.

### pylidar
[http://www.pylidar.org](http://www.pylidar.org) 

Python module for reading, writing and processing LiDAR datasets.

### Tuiview
[http://www.tuiview.org](http://www.tuiview.org)

Lightweight Earth Observation (EO) image viewer. 

## Other Software
### Accessing and Storing Data
* [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org) - Reading and writes pretty much all the file formats we use and provides a set of useful tools for manipulating data.
* [RIOS](http://rioshome.org) - Python module for access image pixel values for analysis.
* [Open Data Cube](https://www.opendatacube.org) - Python module for storing and accessing very large timeseries of raster data.

### Visualisating Data
* [QGIS](https://qgis.org) - Open source graphical GIS software.
* [Cartopy](http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/) - Python module for making maps, built on Matplotlib.

### Useful Python Modules
* [Python-FMASK](http://pythonfmask.org) - This is a python implementation of the FMask algorithm for cloud masking Landsat 4-8 data and Sentinel-2. This library is used with ARCSI to perform cloud masking.
* [scikit-image](http://scikit-image.org) - Python library for manipulating image data. When linked with RIOS it is very powerful in terms of analysing spatial image data.
* [shapely](http://shapely.readthedocs.io) - A python library which provides functionality from the GEOS library for manipulating vector geometries.
* [Fiona](http://toblerity.org/fiona) - A python library for the manipulation of vector data.
* [pyroSAR](https://pyrosar.readthedocs.io) - The pyroSAR package aims at providing a complete solution for the scalable organization and processing of SAR satellite data.
* [PyRAT](https://github.com/birgander2/PyRAT) - General purpose Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) postprocessing software package

### Machine Learning Python Modules
* [scikit-learn](http://scikit-image.org) - A powerful and easy to use machine learning library which can be linked with RIOS to perform many classification and clustering operations. Used a lot within RSGISLib to provide classification functionality.
* [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org) - A core open source library to help you develop and train ML models.
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) - An open source machine learning framework that accelerates the path from research prototyping to production deployment.
* [PyOD](https://pyod.readthedocs.io) - PyOD is a comprehensive and scalable Python toolkit for detecting outlying objects in multivariate data.

### Models
* [DART](http://www.cesbio.ups-tlse.fr/us/dart.html) - DART models radiative transfer in the system "Earth - Atmosphere", from visible to thermal infrared. It simulates measurements (images, waveforms,â€¦) of passive and active (lidar) satellite/plane sensors, as well as the radiative budget, for urban and natural landscapes.
* [Py6S](https://py6s.readthedocs.io) - Py6S is a interface to the Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) atmospheric Radiative Transfer Model through the Python programming language.
