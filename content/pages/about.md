Summary: Background Infomation for the site.


These pages are written and maintained to provide short tutorials and reference to useful software tools for the acquisition and processing of remote sensed Earth Observation data.

These pages are maintained by [Dr Pete Bunting](https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/dges/staff-profiles/listing/profile/pfb/) from the [Department of Geography and Earth Sciences](https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/dges), [Aberystwyth University](https://www.aber.ac.uk). For more information on our research group and [MSc](https://courses.aber.ac.uk/postgraduate/gis-remote-sensing-masters/) and [PhD](https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/dges/prospective/postgraduate/phd-opportunities/physical-geography-earth-science/) opportunities see our [research group web pages](https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/dges/research/earth-observation-laboratory/).

Through my research, I produce and support a number of pieces of software which are made freely available to the community, see the [software](/software) page. My research is mainly focused on environmental remote sensing and spatial data processing for terrestrial environmental problems (e.g., land cover mapping, biophysical parameter estimation such as above ground biomass).
