# Global Mangrove Watch (GMW)
The Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) has produced global mangrove extent maps for 1996, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and annually for 2015-2022. These maps are available to download via the [UN Ocean Data Viewer](https://data.unep-wcmc.org/datasets/45) which provides vector layers or via [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6894272) where global statistics, raster and vector products can be downloaded. The publication for this data is also available [https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14153657](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/15/3657)
